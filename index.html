    <h1>Ms. Lee's Cookbook</h1>
    <p>Growing up, my brother had the privilage of never having tried fast food - my mother ensured that we consistently enjoyed home-cooked meals. Over 20 years, she compiled some of our favorite recipes, keeping note of modifications made to perfection in her big "little" green book. Here, I've typed out some of those recipes to share with the world. Enjoy!</p>
