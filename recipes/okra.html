</head>
<body>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ol>
    <li>3-4 pounds oxtail, goat meat, cow leg (foot cow), about 2 kg boiled with water, salt , onions (for flavor), and stock cubes (Maggi) until tender</li>
    <li>4 oz smoked fish (deboned) About 1 ½ cups</li>
    <li>⅓ cup red palm oil</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
    <li>⅓ cup crayfish (coarsely ground) crayfish is a kind of dried shrimp common in Cameroon, Nigeria, in West Africa</li>
    <li>4 cups beef stock from boiling the meats used in this recipe</li>
    <li>2 seasoning cubes (Maggi) 4g per cube</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>2 habanero peppers (optional)</li>
    <li>1 pound fresh okra (chopped into circles), half kg</li>
    <li>5 oz fresh spinach (roughly chopped)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Boil the Meats. Rinse the meats you choose to use thoroughly then put them in a pot. Add water to just over above the meat. Add salt and seasoning cubes (Maggi) as needed. Also add half a medium onion (chopped). Cover and let it cook on high heat until the meat is tender.</li>
    <li>Note: start boiling tougher meats first before adding the other meats or boil all the meats at the same time then take out the ones that get tender first and leave the others to cook.</li>
    <li>A pressure cooker or an instant pot makes boiling the meats easier.</li>
    <li>Place a pot on high heat and pour in the palm oil. Let it heat up for 2 to 3 minutes then reduce the heat to medium high and add the onions and let them sauté for about 1 minute while stirring from time to time.</li>
    <li>Add the crayfish to the pot and stir for only a few seconds to release its flavor. Do not allow the crayfish in oil for long or the crayfish will burn.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked meats to the pot, followed by their stock. Bring to a simmer, spooning some of the liquid over the meats if they are not completely submerged.</li>
    <li>Add the smoked fish to the pot. Taste for salt then add the 2 seasoning cubes. Note that seasoning cubes are salty so be the judge and use less if your stock was salty enough. Let everything simmer together on medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add the habanero peppers whole to the pot. I do it this way to soften the peppers so those who want spicy soup can press some of the pepper into their soup to release its spiciness.</li>
    <li>However, if you want the entire soup spicy feel free to blend one habanero pepper with water then add it to the soup.</li>
    <li>While the pot simmers prepare the okra. Place about a cup of the okra into a blender or food processor and pulse about 2 seconds at a time to reveal a chopped consistency. (You can see how I do this in the video).</li>
    <li>Repeat the process with all of the okra.</li>
    <li>Add the okra to the pot. Gently stir to ensure it is evenly distributed. Let it cook for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the spinach to the pot and stir in. Let everything cook for another 2-3 minutes. Turn off the heat and serve hot with your fufu of choice.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Types of meat you could use in this okra soup include beef, goat meat, beef tripes, smoked turkey, smoked chicken, beef feet, chicken.</li>
    <li>For fish, you could use smoked fish, dried fish, stock fish, fresh mackerel or any fish with firm flesh.</li>
    <li>If using stock fish, you'll have to cook it separately until done then add to the pot at the same time the recipe calls for fish to be added.</li>
    <li>All smoked fish and dried fish must be properly deboned before adding to the pot.</li>
    <li>To make spicy okra soup, blend one habanero pepper and add to the pot.</li>
</ol>
