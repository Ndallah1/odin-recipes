    <h2>Key Ingredients For Jollof Rice</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Long Grain Rice:</strong> For this recipe I used Jasmine rice. Other great rice choices for Jollof Rice are Basmati rice or parboiled rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> A combination of fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce or paste makes excellent Jollof rice. Use roma tomatoes as they are not as acidic as other kinds of tomato. Jollof Rice should be tomatoey but the tomatoes shouldn't make the rice tangy.</li>
        <li><strong>Onions:</strong> Onions bring an incredible amount of flavor to the rice</li>
        <li><strong>Stock Cubes:</strong> Also known as bouillon cubes or Maggi, stock cubes are key in adding flavor to Jollof Rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic and Ginger</strong> The combination of garlic ginger works wonders in making Jollof Rice tasty. Do not skip it.</li>
        <p>Other ingredients that could really take your Jollof Rice to the next level include white pepper, bay leaves, dried or fresh thyme, basil, parsley celery, fresh or dried rosemary, curry powder, habanero (or scotch bonnet pepper for heat), and smoked paprika or regular paprika.</p>
        <p>I didn't use every single ingredient listed above in this Jollof Rice recipe. I used the key ingredients with some added herbs and spices ingredients for a flavor boost. I want you to know of different herbs and spices you could experiment with in your Jollof Rice.</p>

            <li>4 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>6 large roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>16 -17 oz tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>6 cups jasmine rice or other long grain rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced/sliced carrots</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced/sliced green beans</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend the spices. Place the garlic and ginger into a blender. Add about a quarter cup of water. Blend into a paste.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken. Place the chicken into a pot. Add in about one quarter of the diced onion. Add in two tablespoons of the blended garlic and ginger, half teaspoon of the white pepper, one and a half teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder. Toss everything to combine.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken. Add 3 cups of water to the chicken. Bring to a boil on high heat then let it simmer on medium heat for about 18 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook the tomatoes. Add fresh tomatoes to blender and blend to a paste. Do not add water while blending. Pour the blended tomatoes into a medium saucepan. Let it cook on medium heat for 20 minutes until the tomatoes shrink. Do not stir while the tomatoes cook down.</li>
            <li>Prep chicken for frying. Remove the chicken from its stock using a frying spoon and place in a colander to drain. Reserve the stock.</li>
            <li>Note: I reserved two cups of stock.</li>
            <li>Fry chicken. Place oil in a frying pan up to 2 inches. Let the oil heat up then add the chicken to the oil and fry until golden brown. When one side turns golden, flip to the other side.</li>
            <li>Remove fried chicken and place on paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Let the oil cool down then take out out one cup of oil to cook the rice.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce for the rice. Place one cup of the oil used in frying the chicken into a non-stick or heavy bottom pot. Let the oil heat up then add the remaining onions. Sauté for two minutes while stirring from time to time until the onions are fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked-down tomatoes to the pot and cook while stirring for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato sauce and cook while stirring from time to time until the sauce shrinks and starts sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Add in the one teaspoon of dried thyme and stir so it releases its flavor.</li>
            <li>Add in the remaining blended garlic and ginger. Stir well and let it cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wash rice. Wash the rice 3-4 times to remove the excess starch.</li>
            <li>Add rice to pot. Add the washed rice to the pot with tomato sauce. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Add in the reserved 2 cups of chicken stock, the remaining one teaspoon of salt, two teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder, half teaspoon of white pepper and 2 bay leaves. Stir everything to combine.</li>
            <li>Add in two cups of water. Cover the pot tightly with a large sheet of aluminum foil (this will help trap the steam into the pot). lace the lead on the pot and reduce the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Cook rice on low. Let the rice cook on low heat for 20 minutes. Open the pot and gently stir the rice being careful not to break the grains.</li>
            <li>Cover the rice again with aluminum foil and the place the lid of the pot on the aluminum foil. (Watch the video to see what I mean.)</li>
            <li>Let the rice cook on low heat for another 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add carrots and green beans. Open the pot and add the diced carrots and green beans. Cover and let the veggies cook with the rice for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fluff and serve. Remove bay leaves, fluff rice with a fork and serve with the fried chicken. You could serve with an additional salad if you so desire.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For this recipe I used jasmine rice but any long grain rice would work as well.</li>
            <li>Instead of frying the chicken you could broil it in the oven until golden brown.</li>
